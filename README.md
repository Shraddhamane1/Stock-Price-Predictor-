🚀 Excited to share my latest project! 🚀

I've been working on a NSE Bank Stock Predictor using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning model. 📈📉

💡 Project Overview:
In this project, I utilized the power of LSTM networks to predict the stock prices of banks listed on the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE). The model is designed to analyze historical stock data and forecast future stock prices with a high degree of accuracy.

🔍 Key Features:

Data Collection: Historical stock data of NSE-listed banks.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing the data for better model performance.
Model Building: Constructing and training the LSTM model.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy and fine-tuning it for optimal performance.
Prediction: Generating stock price predictions and visualizing the results.
🛠 Technologies Used:

Python 🐍
Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
TensorFlow & Keras for building and training the LSTM model
📊 Results:
The model has shown promising results, accurately capturing the trends and making reliable predictions. This can be a valuable tool for investors and financial analysts to make informed decisions.
